>**_The mind should not be kept continuously at the same pitch of concentration, but given amusing diversionsâ€¦ Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not force fertile farmland, as uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental vigor, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers._**
